# DRG-Modding
I'll try to keep these updated, but feel free to bother me if I fall behind! Mod descriptions are the original descriptions posted with the mods and I make no apologies for their general lack of helpfulness. Published mods can be found on [mod.io](https://mod.io/members/theinevitableluke) or wherever mods are sold. All of the mods I publish will be in the [Mods](https://github.com/TheInevitableLuke/DRG-Modding/Mods) folder, along with a wildly inconsistent amount of source code. Some have all of the modified game files, all of the test iterations from development, and multiple versions. Some have... significantly less than that. I blame elves.

## Approved Mods

### Cave Leech Clusterfuck
Do you feel like Cave Leech Clusters need more leeches? Do you think leeches are too big, or too slow? Do you have a nuisance Scout you're looking to dispose of? Look no further - Cave Leech Clusterfuck is the mod for you!
- Makes ~~smaller,~~ faster leeches
- Makes a lot more leeches (but only in missions with the modifier)
- Renames Cave Leech Cluster to Cave Leech Clusterfuck in mission selection
- Increases hazard bonus
- ~~May not behave quite right on all mission types (Refinery has been... odd so far)~~

- v1.1: Squashed bug where leeches would block each other's line of sight. They will no longer overlap, and will **all** try to grab you. Many apologies for the inconvenience.
- v1.2: Improved cave leech tessellation. Fewer opportunities to see that pesky "ceiling" that used to appear between our glorious overleeches. **Accept the leech. Love the leech.**

### Socially Distant Cave Leeches
Hoxxes IV seems to be running low on masks, so the cave leeches have been instructed to improve their social distancing. Cave leeches will enthusiastically buzz around you, but _almost_ certainly will not be able to grab you (and if one does, please send me a clip!)

### YOINK
Grabbers _really_ overstay their welcome - but not anymore! Try YOINK™️ today to see your grabber woes go away! (Warning: scout may also go away)
- Grabbers only carry you for 5 seconds, not 20
- Grabbers go fast, so you can still go far

### Dysonators
Dysonators are management's favorite variant of Crassus detonators - they're easy to kill, they can complete half the mission in an instant, and sometimes the team sent down even survives! Plus, they replace a bug-infested cave with a nice Dyson sphere, to extract energy from the sun. _Coming soon: sun_

### Dysonator Jr
Sometimes, a young Dysonator will seek out mining teams before it can truly wreck your map. Don't underestimate them though - they'll still make for an interesting mission!

### Krampus Detonators
Crassus detonators give you a lot of gold. Krampus Detonators... aren't as generous

### I Feel Dirty
Look, I'm too hungover to make anything all _that_ original. So yeah, here's a crassus that some weirdo shoved a bunch of dirt into. [Preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs5RV4GW01U)

### ddetonators
ddoubles ddown on ddetonator stats - mainly carve radius

### Deep Rock - The Skating Rink
You asked and management delivered! The Hoxxes Luxury Skating Rink is ready for use!

### The Ice Dorf Cometh
Ice usually speeds you up, but not like this. Pairs exquisitely with _Deep Rock - The Skating Rink_

### Codependent Molly
Molly doesn't want to be left alone. She gets anxious in these caves, y'know?

### Only Elite Deep Dives
Well we've had one EDD yes, but what about _second_ EDD?
The DD is replaced with another EDD. The missions appear to generate differently, but consistently ...and clients may also want to be running it, as otherwise it wants to grant negative XP.

### Rated 18+
You need 69 gunk seeds to complete the secondary. Don't worry, enough will spawn.

### Rated 3090+
You need 69 gunk seeds to complete the secondary. Don't worry, enough will spawn - enough that you'll need a beefy computer to stay at high fps.

### Reverse Low2
Take your time exploring the cave, but steer clear of any O2 "sources"

### Hold E Simulator
Rated E Forever™️
Have you ever felt like you were just getting into the rhythm of holding E down, when suddenly the game heartlessly rips the E button away from you, along with your sense of meaning and purpose in the world? Same. Hold E Simulator will help! Spend more time holding E and less time on whatever other trivial nonsense keeps trying to distract you.

### Tooth Nexus
Gives the brood nexus some teeth.
WARNING: ~~brood~~ tooth nexus **will** share teeth

### Naedocyte Boomer
Replaces those dumb electro-jellyfish jerkbags with bulks. Not in the same quantity (that mod can exist if desired though, of course), and with a delay between bursts

### Supercritical Breeder Reactor
Naedocyte breeders now spawn brood nexii.

Brood nexii, swarmer eggs, and swarmer tunnels now spawn naedocyte breeders.

This gets out of hand pretty quick. If the breeder reaction passes criticality, there's really no coming back.

**IMPORTANT:** do not set the spawn cap over **500**. The game **will** crash if more than 500 breeders are spawned (although you'll lose all your frames long before that). I recommend between 100 and 300; the nexii are not constrained by this, though, so if things do get out of hand, get out of there fast.


## Sandbox Mods
Maybe these will break your game with credits and XP, maybe they'll break your game by crashing it. Only one way to find out! (Don't worry, crashing just means you have to reboot - these won't actually _break_ the game, ever)

### The Real Crassus
Re-made Banagement's original _The Real Crassus_ as the template for _The Real Krampus_. It makes a lot of gold.

### The Realest Crassus
This was a bad idea. No carve radius, turns everything within 50m to gold. This was a bad idea.

### The Real Krampus
Krampus Detonators aren't particularly helpful. The Real Krampus makes them actively **un**helpful

### The Realest Krampus
This is _The Realest Crassus_, but with Morkite.

### sALLt
Also _The Realest Crassus_, this time with salt. May actually have a larger radius, but I'd have to unpak the file to check. (Not published on mod.io yet, but I can if there's interest)

## Some Random Stuff I Did
I'm also including a few text files with helpful stuff (an index of all of the game files and a quick description of some useful CMD commands)
